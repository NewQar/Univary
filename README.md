# **The project is called Univary.**

A platform where all lecturers and students from all ages can watch live webinars from universities, enter classes that spark their interest and gain new knowledge while keeping privacy and your data at top priority. A place only for professionalism and educational purposes. Starts off with a login and signup page and straight to the dashboard. There, features such as live classes, categories of live webinars, search classes/webinars and also a profile editor. A platform that not only helps students grow in their personal or professional way but also a way to unite every single university from different part of he world.
